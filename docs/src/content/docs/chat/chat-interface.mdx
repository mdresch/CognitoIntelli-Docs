# Chat Interface - Converse with AI Agents

The **Chat Interface** in CognitoIntelli is your primary way to interact with AI agents in a conversational manner. This interface provides a clean and intuitive environment for you to send messages to AI agents, receive their responses, and engage in dynamic, turn-based conversations.

Use the Chat Interface to:

- **Have Natural Conversations with AI:** Engage in interactive dialogues with AI agents, asking questions, providing instructions, and receiving responses in a chat-like format.
- **Get Real-time Assistance:** Receive immediate help, information, and creative outputs from AI agents directly within the chat interface.
- **Test Prompts and Ideas:** Quickly test prompts and explore different conversation directions with AI agents in an interactive setting.
- **Utilize Different AI Models and Agents (If Applicable):** [*(If you have model/agent selection in the chat UI)*] Select from different AI models or agent personas within the chat interface to tailor the conversation to your needs.
- **Review Conversation History:** Access and review past conversations to refer back to previous interactions and information.
- **Copy and Share Responses:** Easily copy and share AI responses for use in other applications or for documentation.

## Features of the Chat Interface

- **Message Input Area:** A clear and prominent input area at the bottom of the interface to type and send your messages to the AI agent.
- **Message Display Area:** A scrollable chat window displaying the conversation history, with clear visual distinction between user messages and AI agent responses.
- **Streaming Responses:**  AI agent responses are displayed in a streaming fashion, word-by-word, providing a more engaging and real-time conversational experience.
- **Message History Sidebar (Optional):** [*(If you have a message history sidebar)*] A sidebar (typically on the left side) displaying a list of past conversations, allowing you to select and load previous chat sessions.
- **Model Details Sidebar (Optional):** [*(If you have a model details sidebar)*] A sidebar (typically on the right side) displaying details about the currently active AI model, providing context on the model's capabilities and settings.
- **Message Actions:**  Contextual actions available for individual messages:
    - **Copy Message:**  Copy the message text to your clipboard.
    - **Like/Dislike Feedback (Future Feature):** [*(If you plan to add this later)*] Options to provide feedback on AI responses (e.g., thumbs up/down) to help improve AI performance (if you implement feedback collection).
- **Model Selection in Chat (Optional):** [*(If implemented)*]  A control within the chat interface (e.g., a dropdown menu) to allow you to switch between different AI models for the current conversation.
- **Agent Selection in Chat (Optional):** [*(If implemented)*] A control within the chat interface to allow you to select different AI agent personas or roles for the conversation.
- **Clear Visual Distinction of Message Roles:** User messages and AI agent messages are visually distinct (e.g., different background colors, alignment, avatars) for easy readability and conversation flow understanding.

## How to Use the Chat Interface

1.  **Navigate to the Chat Interface:** Access the chat interface by clicking on the "Chat" or "AI Chat" link in the main navigation menu.

2.  **Start a New Conversation (If Necessary):**  If you are starting a completely new conversation (and not loading a previous one from history), ensure you are in a fresh chat session.  (In some UIs, you might need to click a "New Chat" button).

3.  **Enter Your Message in the Input Area:**  Locate the message input area at the bottom of the chat interface. Type your message, question, instruction, or prompt into the input field.

4.  **Send Your Message:**  Click the "Send" button (or press Enter/Return key) to send your message to the AI agent.

5.  **View the AI Response:**  The AI agent's response will appear in the message display area above your input field. You will typically see the response generate in a streaming fashion, word by word.

6.  **Continue the Conversation:**  After receiving the AI's response, you can continue the conversation by typing your next message in the input area and sending it.  The conversation will flow in a turn-based manner, with you sending messages and the AI agent responding.

7.  **Use Message Actions (Optional):** For individual messages in the chat history, you may have actions available:
    - **Copy Message:** Hover over a message (or click on it) to reveal a "Copy" icon button. Click the "Copy" button to copy the message text to your clipboard.
    - **Like/Dislike (If Implemented):** [*(If you have feedback buttons)*] If "Thumbs Up" and "Thumbs Down" buttons are present, use them to provide feedback on the quality or relevance of AI responses.

8.  **Access Message History Sidebar (Optional):** [*(If you have a history sidebar)*] If a message history sidebar is visible (typically on the left side), you can:
    - **Browse Past Conversations:** Scroll through the list of past conversations in the sidebar.
    - **Select a Conversation:** Click on a conversation in the list to load and view the message history of that past chat session in the main chat display area.

9.  **View Model Details Sidebar (Optional):** [*(If you have a model details sidebar)*] If a model details sidebar is visible (typically on the right side), you can:
    - **Review Model Information:**  See details about the currently active AI model, such as its name, description, and key parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens).
    - **Potentially Adjust Model Settings (If Implemented):** [*(If you allow model selection/parameter adjustment within the chat)*] You may be able to use controls in the model details sidebar to switch between different AI models or adjust model parameters for the current conversation (if this functionality is provided in your UI).

## Tips for Effective Chatting with AI Agents

- **Start with Clear Prompts:**  Craft clear, concise, and well-defined prompts to ensure the AI agent understands your request and can provide relevant and helpful responses.
- **Be Specific and Provide Context:**  Provide sufficient context and details in your prompts to guide the AI agent and get more targeted responses.
- **Iterate and Refine Your Prompts:**  If the initial AI response is not exactly what you were looking for, refine your prompt, rephrase your question, or provide more specific instructions and send it again.  Chatting with AI is often an iterative process of prompt refinement.
- **Ask Follow-Up Questions:**  Engage in a natural conversation flow by asking follow-up questions based on the AI's responses to explore topics in more depth or clarify specific points.
- **Use Message Actions to Your Advantage:**  Utilize the "Copy Message" action to easily reuse AI responses in other applications or documents.
- **Explore Different AI Models and Agents (If Available):** [*(If you have model/agent selection)*] Experiment with different AI models and agent personas to see how they respond to the same prompts and discover which models or agents are best suited for different types of conversations or tasks.
- **Review Conversation History to Recall Past Interactions:** Use the message history sidebar to access and review past conversations, especially if you need to refer back to information or insights from previous chat sessions.
