# Automate with AI

The **AI Workflows Builder** in CognitoIntelli empowers you to automate tasks and create powerful workflows by combining the intelligence of AI models with other actions and services. This visual builder allows you to design, build, and manage automated sequences of steps that can streamline your workflows, enhance productivity, and automate repetitive tasks.

Use the AI Workflows Builder to:

- **Automate Repetitive Tasks:**  Automate tasks that involve AI processing, data manipulation, and integrations with other systems.
- **Create Intelligent Workflows:**  Build workflows that leverage AI for tasks like content generation, summarization, data analysis, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Connect AI with Other Actions:**  Combine AI steps with other actions like sending emails, saving data to databases, triggering webhooks, and interacting with external APIs.
- **Streamline Processes:**  Simplify complex processes by automating multi-step workflows involving AI and other services.
- **Enhance Productivity:**  Automate time-consuming tasks, freeing up your time for more strategic and creative work.
- **Build Custom AI Applications:** Create custom AI-powered applications and automations tailored to your specific needs and use cases.

## Features

- **Visual Workflow Designer:**  A drag-and-drop interface to visually design workflows by adding and connecting steps.
- **Step-Based Workflow Creation:** Build workflows step-by-step, defining a sequence of actions to be executed automatically.
- **Diverse Step Types:**  Access a library of pre-built step types, including:
    - **AI Model Steps:**  Steps that utilize AI models for tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, etc. (e.g., "Generate Text with AI", "Summarize Document").
    - **Action Steps:** Steps that perform actions beyond AI processing (e.g., "Send Email", "Save to Database", "Create Calendar Event", "Webhook").
    - **Data Transformation Steps:** Steps to manipulate and transform data within the workflow (e.g., "Extract Data", "Format Data", "Filter Data").
    - **Control Flow Steps:** Steps to control the flow of the workflow (e.g., "Conditional Branch", "Loop", "Wait").
- **Step Configuration:**  Easily configure parameters and settings for each step in your workflow through intuitive input fields and dropdowns.
- **Workflow Templates:**  Start with pre-built workflow templates for common automation scenarios to quickly create workflows or get inspiration.
- **Workflow Management:**  Manage your created workflows:
    - **Save & Load Workflows:** Save and load workflows for later editing and reuse.
    - **Organize Workflows:**  Organize workflows into folders or categories.
    - **Duplicate Workflows:**  Easily duplicate existing workflows to create variations or build upon them.
    - **Delete Workflows:**  Delete workflows that are no longer needed.
- **Workflow Execution & Monitoring:**
    - **Run Workflows Manually:**  Trigger workflow execution manually on demand.
    - **Scheduled Workflows (Future Feature):** [*(If you plan to add this later)*] Schedule workflows to run automatically at specific times or intervals.
    - **Workflow Run History (Future Feature):** [*(If you plan to add this later)*]  View a history of workflow executions, including status, run time, and logs.
- **Workflow Export & Import (Future Feature):** [*(If you plan to add this later)*] Export and import workflow definitions to share workflows or transfer them between systems.

## How to Use the AI Workflows Builder

1.  **Navigate to the AI Workflows Builder Page:** Access the builder by clicking on the "AI Workflows Builder" link in the main navigation menu.

2.  **Create a New Workflow:**
    - **Click "Create Workflow":** Click the "Create Workflow" button to start building a new workflow.
    - **Enter Workflow Name:** In the "Create New Workflow" card, enter a descriptive name for your workflow and click "Create & Edit". This will open the Workflow Editor canvas.

3.  **Design Your Workflow in the Visual Editor:**
    - **Drag and Drop Steps:**  From the step palette (usually on the left or right sidebar), drag and drop step types onto the workflow canvas to add them to your workflow.
    - **Connect Steps:**  Use your mouse to drag connectors between steps to define the flow of data and execution sequence. Connect the output of one step to the input of the next step in your desired workflow logic.
    - **Arrange Steps:**  Arrange steps visually on the canvas to create a clear and logical flow.

4.  **Configure Workflow Steps:**
    - **Select a Step:** Click on a step in the workflow canvas to select it.
    - **Open Step Configuration Panel:**  A configuration panel (usually on the right sidebar) will open, displaying the settings and parameters for the selected step.
    - **Configure Step Parameters:**  Fill in the input fields, select options from dropdowns, and adjust settings in the configuration panel to customize the behavior of the step.  The available parameters will vary depending on the step type.
    - **Example Step Configurations:**
        - **"Generate Text with AI" Step:** Configure the AI model to use, the prompt to send to the model, temperature, max tokens, etc.
        - **"Send Email" Step:** Configure the recipient email address, subject line, email body (which can include data from previous workflow steps), and email sender settings.
        - **"Save to Database" Step:** Configure the database connection details, table name, and data mapping to save data from previous steps into a database.

5.  **Save Your Workflow:**  Click the "Save" button (usually in the header or toolbar) to save your workflow design. Give your workflow a meaningful name when saving.

6.  **Run Your Workflow:**
    - **Click "Run":**  Click the "Run" button (usually in the workflow editor toolbar or workflow list) to execute your workflow.
    - **Manual Trigger:** Workflow execution will typically start immediately when you click "Run" (for manually triggered workflows).

7.  **Monitor Workflow Execution (Future Feature):** [*(If you implement workflow run history/monitoring)*]
    - **View Run History:** Access a "Run History" or "Workflow Runs" section to see the status and details of previous workflow executions.
    - **Check Logs and Status:** Review workflow execution logs and status indicators to monitor the progress and identify any errors or issues during workflow runs.

8.  **Manage Your Workflows:**
    - **Workflow List:**  Use the main Workflows Builder page to view a list of all your created workflows.
    - **Edit Workflows:** Select a workflow from the list and click "Edit" to open it in the Workflow Editor for modifications.
    - **Duplicate Workflows:** Duplicate a workflow to create a copy that you can then modify without altering the original.
    - **Delete Workflows:** Delete workflows that are no longer needed from the workflow list.

## Example Workflow Templates (If Available)

[*(If you provide pre-built workflow templates, describe them here. If not, you can remove this section or keep it for future expansion)*]

Example Workflow Templates might include:

- **Daily News Summary Workflow:** (Describe steps and purpose)
- **Automated Email Responder Workflow:** (Describe steps and purpose)
- **Content Idea Generator Workflow:** (Describe steps and purpose)

## Tips for Designing Effective AI Workflows

- **Start with a Clear Goal:** Define the specific task or process you want to automate before you start building the workflow.
- **Break Down Complex Tasks into Steps:**  Divide complex workflows into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Think About Data Flow:**  Carefully consider how data will flow between steps in your workflow. Ensure that the output of one step is compatible with the input of the next step.
- **Use Appropriate Step Types:**  Select step types that are best suited for each part of your workflow. Combine AI steps with action steps and data transformation steps as needed.
- **Test and Iterate:**  Build your workflow step-by-step, testing each part as you go. Run your workflow frequently and iterate on the design based on your testing and results.
- **Use Workflow Templates as Inspiration:**  Explore pre-built workflow templates to get ideas and starting points for your own workflows.
- **Document Your Workflows:**  Add comments or descriptions to your workflow steps and overall workflow to document its purpose and logic for future reference and maintainability.
- **Consider Error Handling (Advanced):** [*(If you implement error handling features)*] For more robust workflows, implement error handling logic to gracefully handle potential issues or failures during workflow execution.
