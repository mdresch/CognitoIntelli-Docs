## How to Use the AI Knowledge Base

1.  **Navigate to the Knowledge Base Page:** Access the Knowledge Base management interface by clicking on the "Knowledge Base" or "AI Knowledge Base" link in the main navigation menu.

2.  **Add a New Knowledge Source:**
    - **Click "Add Source":** Click the "Add Source" button. This will open the "Add Knowledge Source" card.
    - **Select Source Type:** Choose the type of knowledge source you want to connect (Website, Upload Files, Database, etc.) by clicking on the corresponding icon/card.
    - **Enter Source Details:**  Depending on the source type, you will be prompted to enter specific details:
        - **Website:** Enter the website URL you want to connect.
        - **Upload Files:**  Use the file upload interface to upload files from your computer.
        - **Database:**  Enter database connection details (connection string, credentials, etc.).
        - **[Other Source Types]:** *[Describe the input required for any other source types you support]*
    - **Click "Add":** Click the "Add" button to add the new knowledge source.

3.  **Manage Knowledge Sources:**
    - **View Source List:**  The main Knowledge Base page displays a list of your connected knowledge sources.
    - **Review Source Information:** For each source in the list, you can see:
        - **Source Name:**
        - **Source Type:**
        - **Status:** (Synced, Syncing, Error)
        - **Item Count:**
        - **Last Sync Date:**
    - **Check Source Status:**  Pay attention to the "Status" indicator for each source to ensure your knowledge bases are synchronized and up-to-date.  If a source shows an "Error" status, investigate and troubleshoot the connection.
    - **Enable/Disable Sources:** Use the toggle switch next to each source to enable or disable it. Disabled sources will not be used by AI agents.
    - **Delete Sources:** Click the "Trash" icon button to delete a knowledge source that is no longer needed. **Warning:** Deleting a source will remove its data from the knowledge base.

4.  **Monitor Source Synchronization:**
    - **View Sync Status:**  Observe the "Status" indicator for each source. "Syncing" status indicates that the source is currently being updated. "Synced" status indicates successful synchronization. "Error" indicates a problem during synchronization.
    - **Manual Sync (if available):** If you have a "Sync Now" or "Refresh" button, you can use it to manually trigger synchronization for a specific source.

## Tips for Effective Knowledge Base Management

- **Start with Key Knowledge Sources:** Begin by connecting your most important and frequently used knowledge sources first.
- **Organize Sources by Type or Topic:** Use descriptive names for your knowledge sources to easily identify and organize them by type (e.g., "Company Website", "Product Documentation PDFs", "Customer FAQ Database") or topic.
- **Regularly Update Sources:** Keep your knowledge bases up-to-date by ensuring sources are synchronized regularly (either automatically or manually). Outdated information can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant AI responses.
- **Monitor Sync Status and Address Errors:**  Periodically check the synchronization status of your knowledge sources and promptly address any errors to ensure data integrity.
- **Use Knowledge Base Settings to Control AI Behavior:**  Utilize the "Use Knowledge Base in Chat" and "Cite Sources" settings to fine-tune how your AI agents interact with and leverage the knowledge base.
- **Analyze Usage Analytics to Optimize:**  Regularly review the "Usage & Analytics" data to understand how your knowledge base is being used and identify areas for improvement, such as adding more relevant sources, optimizing content, or refining AI agent prompts to better utilize the knowledge base.
